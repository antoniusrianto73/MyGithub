  1. What is the data-type usually used in arithmetic operation?
      long   :Neither operand is a float or a double (integer arithmetic); at least one operand is a long.
      int	   :a variable declared to be of type int can be used to contain integral values only, values that do not contain decimal places.
      char   :data type can be used to store a single character, such as the letter ’a’, the digit character ’6’, or a semicolon (’;’)
      float	 :can be used for storing floating-point numbers (values containing decimal places).
      double :type is the same as type float, only with roughly twice the precision
      boolean :data type can be used to store just the values 0 or 1. Variables of this type are used for indicating an on/off, yes/no, or true/false situation.
  
  2. What is the data-type usually used in word and character?
       char   :data type can be used to store a single character, such as the letter ’a’, the digit character ’6’, or a semicolon (’;’)
       String :generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, 
       typically characters, using some character encoding
       
  3. The output of code below is : 113
      class area {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 100 +3 * 5 -10 / 5;
		    System.out.println(a);
   }
 }
 
 4. The output of code below is : 2
  class average {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 0;
        for ( int i=0; i<6; ++i){
            a= a +2;
        }	 
		    System.out.println(a/6);
    }
