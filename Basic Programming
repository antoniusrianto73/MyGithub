What is the data-type usually used in arithmetic operation?
  long   :Neither operand is a float or a double (integer arithmetic); at least one operand is a long.
  int	   :a variable declared to be of type int can be used to contain integral values only, values that do not contain decimal places.
  char   :data type can be used to store a single character, such as the letter ’a’, the digit character ’6’, or a semicolon (’;’)
  float	 :can be used for storing floating-point numbers (values containing decimal places).
  double :type is the same as type float, only with roughly twice the precision
  boolean  :data type can be used to store just the values 0 or 1. Variables of this type are used for indicating an on/off, yes/no, or true/false situation.
